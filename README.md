# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_ENGINEERING_GRADUATE_DATASET_ANALYSIS
This project is a Classification Model predicting the career path (salary bracket) of engineering graduates. It utilizes the Engineering_graduate_salary dataset, processing features like academic scores and demographics. Key steps included imputing missing values with the mean and removing outliers using the Z-score. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 65.84% on the test set, demonstrating moderate predictive power.
